# pdf_crawl
### Intended to crawl a given url and download all PDF files. Designed to replicate web folder structure when crawling files.

#### NOTE: Still a work in progress.

This is a simple crawler that downloads PDF files from a given url and saves them in a local directory. Built as a practice project + intended to circumvent the 'PDFs hidden behind JavaScript' problem I have encountered with a few other crawlers.
